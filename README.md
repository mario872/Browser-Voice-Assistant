# Isaac
## A 4th Genration Voice Assistant
I'm just going to say right at the outset, this thing is horrible, the code is buggy most of the time, there's unused code pieces, and it's uncommented. So... Have fun!
Goodness that took a while! I've now pushed commits for a stable version of Isaac, not incredibly stable, but definitely usable. And, instead of using Bard, I've now pushed the commit so that if it doesn't knwo the answer to a question, it will just send the quesiton to an AI (Google PaLM).

Checklist:
- [ ] Home assistant - It did work, and now it's broken, don't know why
- [x] Play/pause control - Yep
- [x] Play songs from voice command - Beta, stable, but needs some tweaks for optimisation
- [ ] Open apps - Pre-Alpha, very buggy and hard to configure for newer users
- [ ] Google Bard - Did work, now doesn't.
- [x] Google PaLM
- [x] Image Generation
