# Browser Hosted Voice Assistant
## A Voice Assistant as portable as your browser!
Goodness that took a while! I've now pushed commits for a stable version of Isaac, not incredibly stable, but definitely usable. And, instead of using Bard, I've now pushed the commit so that if it doesn't knwo the answer to a question, it will just send the quesiton to an AI (Google PaLM).

Checklist:
- [ ] Home assistant - It did work, and now it's broken, don't know why
- [x] Play/pause control - Yep
- [x] Play songs from voice command - Beta, stable, but needs some tweaks for optimisation
- [ ] Open apps - Pre-Alpha, very buggy and hard to configure for newer users
- [ ] Google Bard - Did work, now doesn't.
- [x] Google PaLM
- [x] Image Generation
