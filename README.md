# Browser Hosted Voice Assistant
## A Voice Assistant as portable as your browser!
Android, iOS, MacOS, even Chromebooks have the voice assistant down-pat. They're all sorted. Windows and Linux however, are vastly unsupported among the voice assistant community (Cortanna was never really any good.) While you might not think having a voice assistant is useful on a desktop machine it is. Ever been making something like a cake, or hacking together a Raspberry Pi project and wanted to pause/play music? Wanted to check the pinout on that raspberry pi, or the instructions on the cake? Now you can! By leveraging the power of access to your computer, speech to text, and text to speech, as well as your choice of ChatGPT or Google Bard, by just speaking (or typing) you can do all this (and more (including home assistant))!

While not all of this is integrated yet, I am actively working on it, and hope for the first release (or whatever doesn't have thousands of bugs) by the end of August.

Checklist:
- [x] Home assistant - Alpha, useable but not incredibly useful yet
- [x] Play/pause control - Yep
- [x] Play songs from voice command - Beta, stable, but needs some tweaks for optimisation
- [ ] Open apps - Pre-Alpha, very buggy and hard to configure for newer users
- [ ] Google Bard - Very soon
- [ ] OpenAI ChatGPT - Later, but next on list

Pushing Above Commits Soon!
